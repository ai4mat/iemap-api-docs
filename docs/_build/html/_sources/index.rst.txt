Welcome to IEMAP API's documentation!
=====================================

The IEMAP API is a set of Python modules that provide a unified interface to the IEMAP data, stored into the ENEA IEMAP Data Lake. The API is designed to be used by the IEMAP web application. The ENEA IEMAP Data Lake is basically a storage for data collected in the Mission Innovation IEMAP project related to simulations and experiementations in material science. Data are indicized into a unified metadata schema stored in a database. Both storage and database are hosted at the ENEA.
